This project addresses the challenge of handling massive amounts of light curve data generated by missions like Kepler and TESS. We demonstrate a pipeline that automates the initial, tedious process of planet hunting 
by converting raw, noisy astronomical data into highly condensed, machine-readable features using the Box-Least Squares (BLS) algorithm.
The core output is a set of quantifiable parameters (Period, Duration, Transit Time) that an AI/ML classifier can use to quickly identify high-confidence exoplanet candidates, making large-scale data analysis feasible.

Our Approach: Feature Engineering with BLS
Instead of passing the entire raw light curve to an AI, we use the Box-Least Squares (BLS) algorithm, a statistical technique optimized for detecting periodic, box-shaped dips (transits) in light curves.
The BLS process yields three crucial data products that serve as the features for rapid classification:
Best Period (P): The orbital period that yields the strongest transit signal.
Transit Depth (δ): The measured drop in flux during the transit.
Transit Duration (τ): How long the transit event lasts.
